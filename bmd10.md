Random Quote: Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall.  Instead he raised you among his own sons, the sweet boys you have butchered, and to my undying shame I trained you in the arts of war.  Would that I had thrust a sword through your belly instead of placing one in your hand.  -  Rodrik Cassel
