Random Quote: Quantum mechanics? We're discussing that now? Stay in your lane! You are not talking about a time machine, which is both a real and theoretical impossibility. You are talking about regrets. So if you want to ask about regrets, just ask about regrets and leave all this time-traveling nonsense out of it! - Walter White
