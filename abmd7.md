Random Quote: Ah, Arya.  You have a wildness in you, child.  The 'wolf blood', my father used to call it.  Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch.  It brought them both to an early grave.  Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it.  You remind me of her sometimes.  You even look like her.  -  Eddard Stark
