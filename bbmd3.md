Random Quote: Once a horse is broken to the saddle, any man can mount him.  Once a beast's been joined to a man, any skinchanger can slip inside and ride him.  Orell was withering inside his feathers, so I took the eagle for my own.  But the joining works both ways, warg.  Orell lives inside me now, whispering how much he hates you.  And I can soar above the Wall, and see with eagle eyes.  -  Varamyr Sixskins
