Random Quote: I wasn't there when the meth was cooked. I wasn't there when it was sold. I didn't witness any of the murders, but I damn well knew what was happening. I was more than a willing participant. I was indispensable. I kept Walter White out of Jail. I laundered his money. I lied for him. I conspired with him and I made millions. - Saul Goodman
