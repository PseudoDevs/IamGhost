Random Quote: When Mom was a groupie in the '70s, her scrambled eggs made her the darling of the MSG loading dock. Lot of songs written about those scrambled eggs:
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"? Originally "She's Got Eggs".
Led Zeppelin? "Scramble On".
Steve Miller? "The Yolker".
If you listen to Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" while eating her eggs, it lines up perfectly. - Barney Stinson
