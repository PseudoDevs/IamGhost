Random Quote: Fine, you guys can have a baby, but only under these conditions:1) You promise to always love me more than the baby.2) Once a month, I get to use the baby to pick up chicks.3) That may involve the baby falling from a two-story window and me heroically catching it.4) No breast-feeding in front of me.5) Forget about 4), you can whip 'em out whenever you want. - Barney Stinson
