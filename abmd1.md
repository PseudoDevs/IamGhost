Random Quote: Some dogs crawled atop me during the night.  My cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it.  Have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me?  It will start again now that I'm back out.  Gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me.  -  Dolorous Edd Tollett
