 - The night we partied with the mole people
 - The night we tracked down Phil Collins, became best friends with him, and talked him into reuniting with Peter Gabriel, and then we got to sing back-up on the new Genesis album and it was awesome!
 - The night we stole a camel!
 - The night you got locked out in your pajamas and Robin landed a freakin' helicopter and there's still time to reunite Genesis! - Barney Stinson
