Random Quote: What is honor compared to a woman's love?  What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms, or the memory of a brother's smile.  Wind and words.  Wind and words.  We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love.  That is our great glory and our great tragedy.  -  Aemon Targaryen
