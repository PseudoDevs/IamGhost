Random Quote: I knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at her father's feet in Evenfall Hall, and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to Storm's End.  She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him, a blind man could see it.  -  Cortnay Penrose
