Random Quote: Saul Goodman is the last line of defense for the little guy. Are you getting sold down the river? He's a life raft. You getting stepped on? He's a sharp stick. You got Goliath on your back - Saul's the guy with the slingshot. He's the righter of wrongs. He's friend to the friendless. - Saul Goodman
