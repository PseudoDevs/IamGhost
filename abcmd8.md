If you want him pulling the chord on some other nerd's panties, I'm your guy."Barney: "I'll teach that kid how to be awesome in ways you and Lily never could. It's going to be legend- wait for it... no, I won't wait for it and neither should little baby Marvin, so maybe it's better if you two just die right now... -dary!" - Barney Stinson
