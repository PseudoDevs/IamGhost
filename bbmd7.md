Random Quote: How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend?1. Never get them wet. In other words, don't let her take a shower at your place.2. Keep them away from sunlight - i. e. don't ever see them during the day.3. Never feed them after midnight. Meaning she doesn't sleep over and you don't have breakfast. - Barney Stinson
